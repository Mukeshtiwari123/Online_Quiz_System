# Online_Quiz_System

The **Online Quiz System** is a comprehensive application designed to manage and conduct quizzes for both admin and regular users. Developed using **Java** for backend functionality and **MySQL** for the database, this system offers robust user management, quiz operations, and a user-friendly interface.

The application is divided into two main user roles:

**1. Admin:** The admin has full control over managing users, quiz questions, and categories.


**2. Regular User:** Regular users can log in, view their details, and participate in quizzes.



**Key Features and Operations:**


**1. User Management:**

   **i. User Login:** The system checks if the username exists in the database. If the username exists, it verifies the password. If the username is new, it stores the userâ€™s credentials in the database and logs them in.

   
   **ii. User Registration:** New users can register by providing a unique username and password. If the username already exists, the system prompts the user to choose a different name.

   
**2. Admin Operations:**

   **i. User Details:** The admin can view all registered user details.


   **ii. Question Management** (future enhancement): Admins can manage quiz questions and their associated details.


   **iii. Category Management:** Admins can manage different quiz categories.


   **iv. Play Quiz:** Admins can participate in quizzes to test the system's performance.

   
**3. Regular User Operations:**

   **i. User Details:** Users can view their personal information.

   
   **ii. Play Quiz:** Users can participate in available quizzes.



**4. Database Integration:**

   **i.** User credentials are stored in a **MySQL** database.

   
   **ii.** The database checks for unique usernames to prevent duplicate entries and ensures secure login.

   
The project is designed to provide a seamless quiz experience with clear separation between admin and user operations, as well as efficient user authentication.
